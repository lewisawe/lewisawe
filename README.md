### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Lewis Sawe here;

## Introduction

Welcome to my Github repository where I share my knowledge and experience on Cloud and DevOps.You will find various projects, tools, and resources that I have used and created during my Cloud and DevOps journey.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies are the foundation of my work on Cloud and DevOps:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: I use AWS extensively for cloud infrastructure management, deployment, and automation.
- **Docker**: I use Docker for containerization and building microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: I use Kubernetes for container orchestration and management.
- **Terraform**: I use Terraform for infrastructure as code to manage and provision cloud infrastructure.

## Projects

I have worked on various projects related to Cloud and DevOps, which are available in this repository. Some of the notable projects are:

- **Cruddur App**: 
- **CloudoForce Sky**: Weekly challenges using va
- **Terraform AWS Infrastructure**: Terraform configuration files that provision and manage AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS instances.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: A Kubernetes deployment that runs a Dockerized Node.js application in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Resources

I have also included various resources related to Cloud and DevOps in this repository. Some of the notable resources are:

- **AWS Cheat Sheet**: A cheat sheet that summarizes some of the most commonly used AWS services and their functionalities.
- **Docker Commands Cheat Sheet**: A cheat sheet that lists some of the most commonly used Docker commands.
- **Terraform Commands Cheat Sheet**: A cheat sheet that lists some of the most commonly used Terraform commands.
- **Jenkinsfile Example**: An example Jenkinsfile that shows how to automate the build and deployment of a Dockerized Node.js application to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read this Cloud/DevOps readme. I hope you find the projects and resources in this repository useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or send me a message. Happy coding!
